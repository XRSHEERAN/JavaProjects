## PartA
The best-case complexity is O(N). Assume that the list is already sorted in order. Than the algorithm will only execute the first for loop. Assume the size of this list is N, then the for loop will run N-1 times and compare the A[i] and A[i+1], which is a simple comparison and constant in time. After loop, no swaping happened and breaks from for loop; this step is also constant. So the total time should be O(N). Thus the complexity of best case is O(N).

if the values in the array are sorted in order.
