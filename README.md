#### Author: Me (Xianrun Qu)

#### Goal: Present my coding projects :)

## List of Projects
* [Employee DB](https://github.com/XRSHEERAN/Java_Station/tree/master/EmployeeDb): Using ArrayList to implement a Database GUI that can store the name and business trips of a company.
* [ImagePlayer](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fischer/cs367/): A loop structure that used to display images
* [Heap](https://github.com/XRSHEERAN/Java_Station/tree/master/Heap): My heap implemented with shadow array
* [MyHashtable](https://github.com/XRSHEERAN/Java_Station/tree/master/MyHashtable): Implementation of hashing and O(1) operations
* [Sorts](https://github.com/XRSHEERAN/Java_Station/tree/master/Sorts): basic sorts (selection, quick, merge, insertion, heap) and a class for sorting. Pretty comprehensive and helpful.
* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/XRSHEERAN/JavaProjects/tree/master/LinearRegression): Java Implementation of Linear Regression
* [Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/XRSHEERAN/JavaProjects/tree/master/ArtificialNeuralNet): Java Implementation of NN
